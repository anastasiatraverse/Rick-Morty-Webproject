# Rick and Morty Universe 

Welcome to the world of Rick and Morty!
For the most important and devoted fans of this animated series, this site was created. There are many of the most interesting and strange characters in the universe of Rick and Morty. Now it is possible to search and study them. 

On the main page, characters are waiting for you that will surprise you!  

Sooooooooo let's get started! 

## Install react 


First, we need to install the react. Everything is very simple :) 
Run in console 
### `npm install --save react react-dom`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Home](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Run Project 

It's time to start the project. To do this, through the terminal, go to the folder with the project and run the command there 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Enjoy! 
We've worked hard and it's time to take a breath. Just try to enjoy this small and difficult (for me) project.
